GitHub-Requests
===============

Collection of feature/bugs/API and other requests developers think that could make GitHub better.

# What is this about

Improve GitHub, because we <3 GitHub. We want to make it better. But it's closed source :(. So the only thing we can do is:
- provide our ideas
- thoughts why things should be changed in a different direction
- have discussions using GitHub issues and iterate on ideas that way
- make UI/UX spikes by saving their web page to disk, hack it and make a PR against this repo - because that's what the __web__ is all about (and because we can)

â€¦. and hope our ideas will be heard and will be implement and will live a lovely life on the nice servers of GitHub Land.

# Fill an Issue

If you have an idea that could make GitHub better, please open an issue and drop in an image if you can.

# Create a Spike

If you already have an imagination of what your idea could look like then save the GitHub page you want to improve to disk, modify it and make a PR agains this repo.
